It deals damage to enemy units and applies a frostbite curse to units in and around the area that prevents regeneration or healing. Frostbitten units will take minor damage over time; if the units drop below a certain percentage of hitpoints, they'll instantly shatter.Upgradable by Aghanim's Scepter."
